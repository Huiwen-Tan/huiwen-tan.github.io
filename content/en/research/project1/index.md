introduction: Some first-row transition metal complexes with $d^4$ to $d^7$ electronic configurations in octahedral molecular geometries exhibit a crossover between low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states under external perturbations such as temperature, light irradiation, pressure, and magnetic field. Dramatic variations in the physical properties of materials, like magnetism, volume, crystal structure, conductivity, and colour, usually accompany such spin crossover (SCO). Consequently, the SCO phenomenon can be characterised by various experimental techniques, including X-ray diffraction, calorimetry, vibrational spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. SCO materials have been extensively studied over recent decades because of their potential applications as molecular switches in nanoscale devices for memory, sensing, display, and actuation. The realisation of these applications relies on the successful design and synthesis of SCO compounds that can undergo spin-state switching under ambient conditions.

Screening SCO materials with desired properties in the laboratory is labour-intensive and time-consuming. First principles, starting from quantum mechanics, can establish the relationship between structure and properties without relying on empirical parameters, thus providing crucial insights into the experimental design of materials with desired properties. Whilst first-principle methods, represented by density functional theory (DFT), can offer accurate predictions, they still face challenges in scaling up to large systems and long timescales owing to current computational limitations. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been reported as a promising complement to first-principles calculations for accelerating the discovery of candidate materials.
