Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an Honours student in Chemistry at [the University of Queensland](https://scmb.uq.edu.au/profile/12166/huiwen-tan), under the supervision of [Prof. Ben Powell](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/BenPowell/index.html) and [Dr Carla Verdi](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/17070/carla-verdi). 

My recent research revolves around first-principles calculations of strongly correlated materials combined with machine learning-accelerated _ab initio_ molecular dynamics simulations, aiming to understand fascinating emergent behaviours in condensed matter phases. 

***I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in theoretical and computational chemistry, with a strong interest in developing new methods for electronic structure theory. Please feel free to contact me via email (h.tan1@student.uq.edu.au).***
