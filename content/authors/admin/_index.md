      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an Honours student in Chemistry at [the University of Queensland](https://scmb.uq.edu.au/profile/12166/huiwen-tan), under the supervision of [Prof. Ben Powell](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/BenPowell/index.html) and [Dr Carla Verdi](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/17070/carla-verdi). 

My recent research revolves around first-principles calculations of strongly correlated materials combined with machine learning-accelerated _ab initio_ molecular dynamics simulations, aiming to understand fascinating emergent behaviours in condensed matter phases. 

***I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in theoretical and computational chemistry, with a strong interest in developing new methods for electronic structure theory. Please feel free to contact me via email (h.tan1@student.uq.edu.au).***
